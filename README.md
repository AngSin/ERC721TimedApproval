# ERC721TimedApproval

An extension on the ERC721 standard. ERC721TimedApproval sets a time limit on an operator's approval for transferring a user's assets when calling `setApprovalForAll`.

The default approval period is set to 1 week in the variable `defaultApprovalTimePeriod`. This can be edited as desired.
